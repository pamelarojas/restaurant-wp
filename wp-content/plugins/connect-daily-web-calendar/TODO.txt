  Change Add Events plugin operation so that if add is not enabled, it
  displays information to the developer on how to do that.

  Add To Calendar button to integrate to Google or other calendars.

  Integrate w/ Google Docs and Microsoft One Drive to allow people to select
  or link to those docs.

  It looks like we might need a switch to disable enqueueing wp-jquery-ui-dialog
  because themes or other plugins are pulling in jquery-ui from a CDN or their own
  private copy... 

  It might be useful to allow reverse and newest as parameters for
  the detailed events list and simple events list. We had someone that
  was listing art exhibits, and the current ones sort to the bottom :(

  Date/Time formatting options on the widget screens, and the settings screen are non-
  obvious. Do something like WordPress does on the Settings | General page.

  Consider adding text-decoration underline to the simple list of events
  items to indicate they are hot. Alternatively, add a hover tooltip inviting
  the user to click. Or, twiddle the opacity a little to visually distinguish...

  When on the shortcode insertion dialog, the tester found "Filter" confusing.
  Add a one-sentence option underneath the dropdown, and perhaps a title 
  attribute to the select options describing each shortcode in a brief sentence.

* AddThis - Create a landing page for events without a link to provide a URL to AddThis.

* Events filter doesn't do resources.

* Display custom fields on events.

* Modify public event creation to support custom fields.

* Subscribe to Notifications Widget, Anonymous notifications and reminders.

* Look at various scripts/css file and see if we can enqueue them at the bottom of the page.

* Look at default Javascript in admin mode.

At some point, make map url base a configuration option.
